AGIEJOY • Private LLM Assistant (Agent Mode Demo)

This project is a front-end demo UI simulating what a private, company-specific Large Language Model (LLM) interface might look like for an internal knowledge assistant.
It was designed for AGIEJOY LLC, a modern feminist clothing brand, as a concept prototype.

Features

Simulated Login — demo credentials to illustrate secure access.

Conversational Chat Interface — chat with a bot that responds with mocked knowledge retrieval.

Agent Mode Transparency — right-hand panel logs tool calls (gmail_search, outlook_search, pdf_search) and their observations.

Connectors Simulation — toggle Gmail, Outlook, and PDF sources to see how the assistant routes queries differently.

Branded UI — styled in AGIEJOY’s modern feminist aesthetic.

Front-end Only — no backend required; runs entirely in the browser.
